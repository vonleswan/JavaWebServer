# JavaWebserver
A cross-platform web server written in java for Algonquin's CST8109
# Introduction
 

### Goals & Objectives
To develop a simple cross-platform web server. 

"From any browser, web server will be connected over a network. Web server will display client and server IP address as in similar Lab exercises we have done so far."

### Statement of Scope
ESSENTIAL: 
Client will request connection to WebServer over HTTP connection. Webserver will provide HTTP response to Client. Response contains HTML specifying Client IP and WebServer IP.

DESIRABLE:
Client will be able to pull additional resources from WebServer (.png , .mp4, etc.)

FUTURE: 
WebServer will accept incoming data to change internal systems

### Software Context

This software is being developed for CST8109 and may be used in future labs for testing connections

### Major Constraints

Time.
